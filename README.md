## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) where the needs and expectations of stakeholders are gathered, analyzed, and documented. This process ensures a clear understanding of what the software should accomplish and helps establish a foundation for the design, development, and testing stages.

### Importance of Requirement Analysis:
1. **Clarity and Understanding**: Defines the project scope and reduces ambiguity in stakeholder expectations.
2. **Efficient Design and Development**: Provides a solid framework for system design and development teams.
3. **Cost and Time Optimization**: Helps estimate project resources, timeline, and budget accurately.
4. **Quality Assurance**: Ensures the final product meets customer needs, enhancing satisfaction and reliability.
5. **Prevents Scope Creep**: By clearly defining boundaries, it avoids unplanned expansions in project requirements.
